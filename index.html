  <h1> What do we do?</h1> 
  <section>
  <h2>How do we calculate streams?</h2>
  <p>We are a statistics company that specializes in data to see trends within music.
    Music is one of the biggest industries with many different people of various backgrouds
that come together to create art. We like to know what kind of music people enjoy and how it changes  
from year to year. These are accuulated by  anytime a track is listened to for 30 seconds. Every 30 seconds is counted as a stream the longer
the song the more streams that is accumulated.</p>
